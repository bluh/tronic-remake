# Introduction
[Neverdaunt:8Bit](http://8bit.neverdaunt.com) is a game made by [RobotLovesKitty](http://robotloveskitty.tumblr.com/), which went offline Summer 2012. Neverdaunt was a game which focused on exploration and building, however it had a programming aspect to it as well, in the form of a visual-based languaged called Tronics.

Minitrons is a project to replicate these Tronics while the game is offline.

# Features
* A functional tronic engine
* Infinite tronic placement and grid space
* The ability to customize or create your own tronics

# Usage
Aside from the source being completely free, a downloadable executable file can be found in the src directory, which requires the .dll files in the folder. A playable .love file (which can be played using the [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/) engine) is also included.
